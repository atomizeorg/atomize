## Introduction

> Currently, the atomize project is in constant development and is not intended to be used in production, even though everything has been tested extensively.

The Atomize project includes several libraries that interact with the React ecosystem (including third-party libraries) to facilitate the development of React applications. Those libararies are **opinionated** and based on popular and cutting-edge techniques.

## What features do atomize libraries have in common?

All libraries:

-   deal with frequently used workflows and try to simplify and standardize them.
-   are type-safe.
-   are opinionated.
-   are modular.
